# Yamapper - Yet Another Database Mapper

Lightweight object-relational mapper for .Net.

Inspired by [NHibernate](http://nhibernate.info/), [mybatis (former ibatis.net)](http://mybatis.org/) and [Subsonic](http://subsonicproject.com/), allows mapping of tables and views through .Net attributes or XML configuration files, having great performance and native compatibility with SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.

*Yamapper* uses [MyGeneration](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mygeneration/) for complete code generation, from entities to views, based on the [recommended architecture](http://intentor.com.br/yamapper-conceitos/).

On the source code there are sample projects explaining the main features of *Yamapper* on desktop, web forms and MVC applications.

Documentation can be found at [Yamapper on from tatooine](http://intentor.com.br/posts/categories/yamapper/) (Brazilian Portuguese only).

The project is in C# 3.5 and 4.0 and most of the comments are in Brazilian Portuguese.

*Yamapper* uses [Castle.Core](https://github.com/castleproject/Core) and [Intentor.Utilities](https://github.com/intentor/utilities).

The releases, although not tied to a source code at this repository, contains binaries and documentations for each released version of the project.

Currently the project is **DISCONTINUED**. However, feel free to fork it and continue its development!
